# Warning

**This project environment is setup to work on windows. I can not guarantee it will work in other environments**.

# Prerequisites

You will need [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or node package manager.

IDE that supports [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I recommend [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This project uses Angular 2 as a framwork. If you do not know it here are some places to start.

[angular.io](https://angular.io/) and
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-angular-2)

# Getting started

Open CMD in the same folder as package.js.

Type and run `npm install`

This will download all dependencies.

Type and run `npm run build:dev`

This will build the project to the dist folder and watch the project files.
First run will takes some time but the next after that will be way faster.
If you make changes to the files it will automatically rebuild the project.

You will get some typing errors. Do not mind those. They have no effect on the acctual code.

Open a new CMD and type and run `npm run server`

This will server the file from a small server and it should open a browser on the correct page.

Happy coding.

# Build new version

Type and run `npm run build:prod`

Open a new CMD and type and run `npm run server`

Test application.

Copy the content in build folder.

Remove app.[hash].js and polyfills.[hash].js from dist folder.

Paste clipboard to dist folder. Overwrite every file.

Commit, push and check if your changes appears on the website.
